Test cases:

Terpenes (TPS):
  - CotB2 (with GGPP and all other intermediates)
  - AS    (with FPP) + read PSF + CRD
  - BPPS  (with GPP and all other intermediates) + with consensus (seq)

Covalent Docking:
  - micha - Michael addition to "Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src"
  - 3js1 - Fatty Acid Binding Protein, with water

Patches to Protein:
  - ProR - Change protonation states during docking
  - SerR - Covalently bound cofactor (PLP). Ligands as CSV file.

Consensus:
  - AbyU - Old style - using harmonic best-fit
  - LepI - Recommended - using PNOE (with user_consensues.csv).
           Includes restraints in 'userrestraints.csv'
